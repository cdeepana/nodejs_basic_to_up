1) npm init in console and do above things

                PS D:\2020_practicle\2020NODEJS\http> npm init
                This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
                It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

                See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
                and exactly what they do.

                Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
                save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

                Press ^C at any time to quit.
